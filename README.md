# CareYourBaby

## Idea

Now a day’s both parent are working outside for their respective job, so because of this no one is with their child who can keep observation like whether child is coming safely from school or not, whether child is happy at school atmosphere or not etc. The proposed system includes a child module which have a gazette with GPS and parent module which includes mobile phone (which supports internet connectivity) for getting the information about the missed child on periodical basis. Addition to the proposed system is that parents don’t have to continuously monitor the location of child, if child is going outside of define area then alert message will be given to parents. Child module have one panic switch, with the help of which child can alert parents These proposed tracking devices can be worn as wrist watches, anklets or in identity-cards. The child module is a hardware based using Arduino, GPS and GSM. 
 
Even though if the child is not aware that if he/she is in danger the app will notify the parents if the child goes out of a certain defined region outside of his school and home. In this way the child can be located if he/she goes missing.
